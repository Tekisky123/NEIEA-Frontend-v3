            Discourse-oriented pedagogy emphasizes interactive and collaborative learning through meaningful discussions, debates, and exchanges of ideas. Across subjects like English, mathematics, social science, and science, NEIEA encourages teachers to design activities that foster critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication among students.

            To achieve this, trigger activities with visuals are used to stimulate learners' thinking process, comprehension is enhanced through pictures and videos, and brainstorming sessions promote collaborative learning. This approach creates an interactive environment where students actively engage with peers, instructors, and participate in discussions.

            The integration of discourse-oriented pedagogy has numerous benefits on students' learning outcomes. It enhances their communication skills, enabling them to express ideas coherently and effectively. The collaborative learning environment nurtures teamwork, empathy, and respect for diverse viewpoints. Moreover, students develop critical thinking abilities, analyzing information, questioning assumptions, and forming well-reasoned opinions. Ultimately, this approach empowers students to think independently, make informed decisions, and become active contributors to society.
